    My Lord My God,
    Tell me what you are to me
    Say to my soul:
    "I am your salvation"
    My heart is listening Lord
    Open the ears of my heart and say:
    "I am your salvation"
    Let me run toward this voice 
    And seize hold of you
    Do not hide your face from 
    Let me die so that i may see it
    For not to see it 
    would be death to me indeed
</pre>
