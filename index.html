    <h2> St Augustine</h2>
    <pre>
My Lord My God,
Tell me what you are to me
Say to my soul:
"I am your salvation"
My heart is listening Lord
Open the ears of my heart and say:
"I am your salvation"
Let me run toward this voice 
And seize hold of you.
Do not hide your face from me,
Let me die so that i may see it
For not to see it 
would be death to me indeed.
    </pre>

    <h2> <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/8073739.Isaac_the_Syrian" target="_blank"> St Isaac the Syrian </a> </h2>

    <pre id = "para1">
A handful of sand, thrown into the sea, 
is what sinning is, 
when compared to God's Providence and mercy. 
Just like an abundant source of water is not impeded 
by a handful of dust, 
so is the Creator's mercy not defeated 
by the sins of His creations.
    </pre>
