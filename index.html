My Lord My God,
Tell me what you are to me
Say to my soul:
"I am your salvation"
My heart is listening Lord
Open the ears of my heart and say:
"I am your salvation"
Let me run toward this voice 
And seize hold of you.
Do not hide your face from me,
Let me die so that i may see it
For not to see it 
would be death to me indeed.
