    <p>
        My Lord My God, <br>
        Tell me what you are to me <br>
        Say to my soul:<br>
        "I am your salvation"<br>
        My heart is listening Lord<br>
        Open the ears of my heart and say:<br>
        "I am your salvation"<br>
        Let me run toward this voice <br>
        And seize hold of you<br>
        Do not hide your face from <br>
        Let me die so that i may see it<br>
        For not to see it <br>
        would be death to me indeed<br>
    </p>
